## React-Native AR Application
* Utilized resources from NewThingsCo's Expo-AR tutorial via GitHub

### How it works:

* The Expo AR app is essentially a snapchat-style filter. It uses the position of your eyes to map the boundaries of your face. It then allows an asset image to be imposed over the user's face, anchored at the eye position.

### Modules

* App.js
* Src
  * index.js
  * Mask
    * index.js

### Running the Application

* Use the 'npm install' command to get node modules and app dependencies placed correctly. 
* Terminal command 'expo start' will begin the server, which provides a QR code.
* Scan QR code with your iOS device to launch application.
